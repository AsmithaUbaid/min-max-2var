# After each test name, a list of problem numbers to skip follows. 
# A test name must be a whole word (by C definitions)
# Note that Seidel is randomized; the problems it fails to solve depend
# on rand(), which changes depending on seed and number of rand() calls prior.
# Note: comments must begin with a # sign, followed by a space
